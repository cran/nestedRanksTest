Description: Calculate a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for a difference between treatment levels using nested ranks.  This test can be used when observations are structured into several groups and each group has received both treatment levels. The p-value is determined via bootstrapping.  The nested ranks test is intended to be one possible mixed-model extension of the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, for which treatment is a fixed effect and group membership is a random effect.
