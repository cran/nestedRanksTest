\description{
A dataset containing distances acorns of two oak species were carried by
acorn woodpeckers (\emph{Melanerpes formicivorus}) to their granaries, in
two different years for each oak species.  Data were collected in oak
savanna habitat in central California.  Acorn woodpeckers store acorns in
central granaries, and different woodpecker social groups maintain
different granaries. The variables are as follows:
\itemize{
    \item Species, the species of oak for the observed acorn ("lobata" for
        \emph{Quercus lobata}, "agrifolia" for \emph{Quercus agrifolia})
    \item Year, the year of observation (2002 and 2004 for
        \emph{Quercus lobata}, 2006 and 2007 for \emph{Quercus agrifolia})
    \item Granary, the woodpecker granary from which the acorn was collected
    \item Distance, distance in metres from the acorn source tree to the
        granary
